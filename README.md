# Diabetes-Predictor
A very simple yet efficient way to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not. 
Libraries used were Pandas,numpy and Scikit learn was widely used.
Firstly data was preprocessed and converted into the wanted format.
We used data standardization and the data was split into training and test set.
Support Vector Machine was used as a core to implement the model.
Then the accuracy was predicted and a random persons data was tested.
